### [Writing Tools](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/ios-ipados-release-notes/ios-ipados-18_5-release-notes#Writing-Tools)

#### [Resolved Issues](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/ios-ipados-release-notes/ios-ipados-18_5-release-notes#Resolved-Issues)

- Fixed: Resolved an issue where the attributes in the NSAttributedString passed in `writingToolsCoordinator(_:replace:in:proposedText:reason:animationParameters:completion:)` (or its companion async form) are stripped when an `NSWritingToolsCoordinator` or `UIWritingToolsCoordinator` has `resultOptions` set to `[.plainText]`. The attributes are no longer stripped but instead use the same attributes as were included by the delegate in the `NSAttributedString` returned in `writingToolsCoordinator(_:requestsContextsFor:completion:)` (or its companion async form).
