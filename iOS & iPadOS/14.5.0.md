#### [New Features](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/ios-ipados-release-notes/ios-ipados-14_5-release-notes#New-Features)

- iPad (8th generation), iPad Air (4th generation), iPad Pro 11-inch (2nd generation), and iPad Pro 12.9-inch (4th generation) now mute the built-in microphone when its Smart Folio is closed. To avoid unnecessarily recording the muted signal, the default behavior is to interrupt an audio session that is using the built-in microphone when the Smart Folio is closed. You can opt out of the playback interruption when the Smart Folio is closed by using the new [`AVAudioSession.CategoryOptions`](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/AVFAudio/AVAudioSession/CategoryOptions-swift.struct) [`overrideMutedMicrophoneInterruption`](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/AVFAudio/AVAudioSession/CategoryOptions-swift.struct/overrideMutedMicrophoneInterruption), allowing the audio session to continue playing uninterrupted while microphone input remains muted. For more information, see [Responding to Audio Session Interruptions](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/AVFAudio/handling-audio-interruptions). (57042856)

### [Siri](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/ios-ipados-release-notes/ios-ipados-14_5-release-notes#Siri)

#### [New Features](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/ios-ipados-release-notes/ios-ipados-14_5-release-notes#New-Features)

- For Music, Podcasts, and Audiobooks requests, updated dialogs for app selection are now available. To ensure your app is set up to participate in Siri app selection, see [Improving Siri Media Interactions and App Selection](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/SiriKit/improving-siri-media-interactions-and-app-selection). (74555773)

### [SKAdNetwork](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/ios-ipados-release-notes/ios-ipados-14_5-release-notes#SKAdNetwork)

#### [New Features](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/ios-ipados-release-notes/ios-ipados-14_5-release-notes#New-Features)

- With view-through attribution, [`SKAdNetwork`](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/StoreKit/SKAdNetwork) now supports all ad formats for promoting apps. (70345857)

#### [Resolved Issues](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/ios-ipados-release-notes/ios-ipados-14_5-release-notes#Resolved-Issues)

- You’re now able to use either version 1.0 or version 2.0 signatures when generated using iOS & iPadOS 14.5 and later. (71474331)

### [SwiftUI](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/ios-ipados-release-notes/ios-ipados-14_5-release-notes#SwiftUI)

#### [New Features](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/ios-ipados-release-notes/ios-ipados-14_5-release-notes#New-Features)

- Added [`TitleAndIconLabelStyle`](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/SwiftUI/TitleAndIconLabelStyle), a new style for [`Label`](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/SwiftUI/Label) views that shows both the title and icon of the label using a system-standard layout. In most cases, labels show both title and icon by default. However, some containers might apply a different default label style to their content, such as only showing icons within toolbars on macOS and iOS. To opt in to showing both the title and the icon, apply the title and icon label style: `Label("Lightning", systemImage: "bolt.fill").labelStyle(TitleAndIconLabelStyle())`. (64646578)
- Types conforming to any style protocol, such as [`ButtonStyle`](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/SwiftUI/ButtonStyle) or [`ToggleStyle`](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/SwiftUI/ToggleStyle), are now enforced to be value types. Styles must be structures or enumerations, not classes, and conforming a class to a style protocol may trigger an assertion. This is the same restriction that the system has always enforced on types conforming to [`View`](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/SwiftUI/View). (62886135)

#### [Resolved Issues](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/ios-ipados-release-notes/ios-ipados-14_5-release-notes#Resolved-Issues)

- You can now apply multiple doc://com.apple.documentation/documentation/swiftui/anyview/sheet(ispresented:ondismiss:content:) and doc://com.apple.documentation/documentation/swiftui/anyview/fullscreencover(item:ondismiss:content:) modifiers in the same view hierarchy. (74246633)
- Drop locations are now accurate when using [`onDrop(of:delegate:)`](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/SwiftUI/View/onDrop(of:delegate:)-6lin8). (74030674)
- The doc://com.apple.documentation/documentation/swiftui/ellipse/keyboardshortcut(\_:)-1xmih modifier now works in UIKit lifecycle apps. (73792634)
- Changes to pages that you provide to a [`TabView`](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/SwiftUI/TabView) with [`PageTabViewStyle`](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/SwiftUI/PageTabViewStyle) are now correctly reflected in the view. (65701336)
- The dismissal animation of a popover modifier when running in a compact horizontal size class now renders as expected. (52606403)
- Setting doc://com.apple.documentation/documentation/swiftui/text/preferredcolorscheme(\_:) to `nil` now correctly resets to the system’s preferred color scheme. (67000774)
- [`NavigationView`](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/SwiftUI/NavigationView) push and pop now correctly respects disabled animations. (70062477)
- [`HoverEffect`](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/SwiftUI/HoverEffect) no longer causes a ghosting effect, especially over Text. (71344349)
- Using the pointer on iPadOS no longer confuses certain gestures. (71344436)
- [`onHover(perform:)`](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/SwiftUI/View/onHover(perform:)) is now recognized as expected in a stack. (71344436)
- The destination of [`NavigationLink`](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/SwiftUI/NavigationLink) that only differs by local state now resets that state when switching between links as expected. (72117345)
- Dynamic properties such as [`State`](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/SwiftUI/State), [`Environment`](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/SwiftUI/Environment), and others now work correctly in [`ButtonStyle`](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/SwiftUI/ButtonStyle) instances. (62886135)
- [`AppStorage`](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/SwiftUI/AppStorage) property wrappers now work as expected when contained inside an [`ObservableObject`](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/Combine/ObservableObject), causing the system to emit the doc://com.apple.documentation/documentation/combine/observableobject/objectwillchange-2oa5v publisher. (65562845)
- [`ProgressView`](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/SwiftUI/ProgressView) instances initialized with a [`Progress`](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/foundation/progress) object now correctly track updates to the `Progress` object from background threads, and no longer issue a “not allowed” console warning. (69999449)
- Using [`scrollTo(_:anchor:)`](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/SwiftUI/ScrollViewProxy/scrollTo(_:anchor:)) without specifying an anchor now scrolls the [`List`](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/SwiftUI/List) the minimum amount to make it visible. (70184639)
- A [`TabView`](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/SwiftUI/TabView) with [`PageTabViewStyle`](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/SwiftUI/PageTabViewStyle) now correctly invokes doc://com.apple.documentation/documentation/swiftui/anyview/onappear(perform:) and doc://com.apple.documentation/documentation/swiftui/anyview/ondisappear(perform:) for its tabs. (71225006)
- [`InlinePickerStyle`](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/SwiftUI/InlinePickerStyle) now resolves as an in-line section if applied to a [`Picker`](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/SwiftUI/Picker) within a [`List`](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/SwiftUI/List) on iOS, watchOS, and tvOS, using a checkmark to indicate the selected option. (71383311)

### [WebKit](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/ios-ipados-release-notes/ios-ipados-14_5-release-notes#WebKit)

#### [New Features](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/ios-ipados-release-notes/ios-ipados-14_5-release-notes#New-Features)

### [Xcode](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/ios-ipados-release-notes/ios-ipados-14_5-release-notes#Xcode)

#### [Deprecations](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/ios-ipados-release-notes/ios-ipados-14_5-release-notes#Deprecations)

- Don’t use the iOS [`MinimumOSVersion`](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/BundleResources/Information-Property-List/MinimumOSVersion) information property list key to declare the minimum release of macOS in which your app runs. Use [`LSMinimumSystemVersion`](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/BundleResources/Information-Property-List/LSMinimumSystemVersion) instead. (73890473)

  - Future releases of macOS ignore the `MinimumOSVersion` key in Mac apps, including apps built with Mac Catalyst.
  - Future releases of macOS use the `LSMinimumSystemVersion` key in iOS apps built with Xcode 12.5 or later. If an iOS app doesn’t include an `LSMinimumSystemVersion` key, future releases of macOS compare the app’s `MinimumOSVersion` with the version of its Mac Catalyst runtime to determine compatibility.
