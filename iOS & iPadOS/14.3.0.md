#### [Deprecations](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/ios-ipados-release-notes/ios-ipados-14_3-release-notes#Deprecations)

The `TargetApplicationBundleIdentifier` in [`WebClip`](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/DeviceManagement/WebClip) is intended for enterprise customers to launch a custom URL in a third-party browser, rather than to provide theming options. Beginning in iOS & iPadOS 14.3, pointing `TargetApplicationBundleIdentifier` to an app made by Apple is no longer supported. A Web Clip already installed via a configuration profile will continue to work; however, the `TargetApplicationBundleIdentifier` property will be ignored in newly installed Web Clips unless the configuration profile is deployed via MDM. For devices not enrolled in MDM, create a single-step shortcut with the Open App action, then add the shortcut to the Home screen. (71422092)
