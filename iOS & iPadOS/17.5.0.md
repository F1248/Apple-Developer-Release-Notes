### [Core Motion](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/ios-ipados-release-notes/ios-ipados-17_5-release-notes#Core-Motion)

#### [New Features](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/ios-ipados-release-notes/ios-ipados-17_5-release-notes#New-Features)

- To respect users’ privacy, apps calling CMAltimeter’s `startRelativeAltitudeUpdatesToQueue` and `stopRelativeAltitudeUpdates` are now required to include the [`NSMotionUsageDescription`](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/bundleresources/information_property_list/nsmotionusagedescription) string in their plist in order to receive data.

  Apps built with SDKs prior to iOS 17.5 and watchOS 10.5 without the `NSMotionUsageDescription` string in their plists will not receive data.

  Apps built with iOS 17.5 and watchOS 10.5 or later will crash if they do not have the `NSMotionUsageDescription` string in their plist as described in [CMAltimeter](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/coremotion/cmaltimeter). (125573971)

#### [New Features](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/ios-ipados-release-notes/ios-ipados-17_5-release-notes#New-Features)

- New Apple Universal Link for eSIM install:

  ```
   https://esimsetup.apple.com/esim_qrcode_provisioning?carddata=LPA:1$GSMA_SMDP_Address$activation_code
  ```

  Universal Links should be all lower case. Only the GSMA activation code (QR code), passed in as `carddata`, is customized for the carrier’s SM-DP+ and eSIM profile. Use the iOS user agent in web requests to determine when to offer Universal Links for eSIM, which are only be enabled on iOS 17.4 and later. (92405493)
