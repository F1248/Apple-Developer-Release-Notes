### [SwiftUI](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/ios-ipados-release-notes/ios-ipados-18_1-release-notes#SwiftUI)

#### [Resolved Issues](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/ios-ipados-release-notes/ios-ipados-18_1-release-notes#Resolved-Issues)

- Fixed: Scene restoration launches the incorrect scene. (132497400)
- Fixed: In apps compiled against SDKs prior to iOS 18.0 and visionOS 2.0, explicit arrow edges are not respected when the app is run on iOS 18.1 or visionOS 2.1. Apps compiled against any macOS SDK will still have the arrow edge respected. (133295608)
- On iOS 18.0, there is a known issue where passing `nil` to the `.preferredColorScheme` modifier, after the preferred color scheme is set by a different view in the hierarchy, does not trigger the system color scheme to change. Starting in iOS 18.1, when `nil` is passed to the `.preferredColorScheme` modifier, the view indicates no preference for the color scheme and thus uses the system color scheme.

  ```
   .preferredColorScheme(isDarkMode ? .dark : nil)

  ```

  The view with the above modifier applied prefers dark mode when `isDarkMode` is set to `true` but otherwise defers to the color scheme as determined by the system. (133689390) (FB14768320)
- Fixed: On iOS, tvOS, and visionOS, `View.navigationSplitViewColumnWidth` (all overloads) does not produce an effect if applied after the `NavigationSplitView` is created. (135434989)
- Fixed: Using `if #available` in @WidgetBundleBuilder and @SceneBuilder crashes on prior OS versions due to “unknown OS version.” (136098106)

### [Telephony](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/ios-ipados-release-notes/ios-ipados-18_1-release-notes#Telephony)

#### [Known Issues](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/ios-ipados-release-notes/ios-ipados-18_1-release-notes#Known-Issues)

- On some managed and supervised devices, the RCS messaging service might not be blocked as expected although the MDM restriction of `allowRCSMessaging` is installed successfully. (137974410)

### [WidgetKit](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/ios-ipados-release-notes/ios-ipados-18_1-release-notes#WidgetKit)

#### [New Features](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/ios-ipados-release-notes/ios-ipados-18_1-release-notes#New-Features)

- A control’s default tint will be set to the App/ extension’s accent color, if a tint is not specified explicitly using the `tint(_:)` modifier. If neither is specified, the control’s tint will be the default system blue tint. (131662481)

#### [Resolved Issues](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/ios-ipados-release-notes/ios-ipados-18_1-release-notes#Resolved-Issues)

- Fixed: Rectangular complications and Watch-specific custom Live Activity views use the wrong font metrics, causing title2 and title3 to render much larger than intended and largeTitle to render much smaller than intended. Additionally, custom Live Activity views use the wrong default font (SF Pro instead of SF Compact). (135831317)
