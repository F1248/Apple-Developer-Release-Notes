### [RealityKit](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/ios-ipados-release-notes/ios-ipados-13_4-release-notes#RealityKit)

#### [Known Issues](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/ios-ipados-release-notes/ios-ipados-13_4-release-notes#Known-Issues)

- After updating to iOS & iPadOS 13.4, you won’t be able to synchronize scenes with peers using earlier versions of RealityKit, due to a fundamental change in the physics system. If two peers running a [`MultipeerConnectivityService`](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/RealityKit/MultipeerConnectivityService) have incompatible versions, they will remain connected in the underlying [`MCSession`](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/MultipeerConnectivity/MCSession), but won’t synchronize scenes. iOS & iPadOS 13.4 adds a new [`NetworkCompatibilityToken`](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/RealityKit/NetworkCompatibilityToken) class so a host can avoid inviting incompatible clients to its [`MCSession`](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/MultipeerConnectivity/MCSession). Please see the [`NetworkCompatibilityToken`](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/RealityKit/NetworkCompatibilityToken) documentation for additional details. (59262764)

### [SwiftUI](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/ios-ipados-release-notes/ios-ipados-13_4-release-notes#SwiftUI)

#### [New Features](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/ios-ipados-release-notes/ios-ipados-13_4-release-notes#New-Features)

- When using a [`NavigationView`](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/SwiftUI/NavigationView) with multiple columns, the navigation bar now shows a control to toggle the columns. (49074511)
- The `onDrag` and `onDrop` modifiers are now available on iOS. (49661347)

#### [Resolved Issues](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/ios-ipados-release-notes/ios-ipados-13_4-release-notes#Resolved-Issues)

- [`safeAreaInsets`](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/SwiftUI/GeometryProxy/safeAreaInsets) in navigation and tab views now extend to the top edge as expected. If you previously used doc://com.apple.documentation/documentation/SwiftUI/AnyView/edgesIgnoringSafeArea(\_:) as a workaround, it should now be removed. (52851281)
