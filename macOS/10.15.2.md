- Certain top-level domains (TLDs) such as `.dev` and `.app` are now in the Foundation [`URLSession`](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/Foundation/URLSession) and [`NSURLConnection`](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/Foundation/NSURLConnection) HTTP Strict Transport Security (HSTS) preload list. An app which uses [`URLSession`](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/Foundation/URLSession) to visit a matching URL will always navigate to the URL as `https://`, and never as cleartext `http://`. See the [HTTP Strict Transport Security (HSTS) Specification](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc6797) for more information about HSTS. (56247242)
