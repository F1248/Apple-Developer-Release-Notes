#### [Known Issues](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/macos-release-notes/macos-15_1-release-notes#Known-Issues)

- macOS apps might crash with an exception related to duplicate toolbar items. This often happens when either (A) `NavigationSplitView`s are nested or (B) toolbars with `id`s are specified (`View.toolbar(id:...)`) and a new window is created with the same identified toolbar. (134589426)

  **Workaround:** (A) Use apply `.toolbar(removing: .sidebarToggle)` within the sidebar column of the inner `NavigationSplitView`. (B) Temporarily stop using identified toolbars until this issue is addressed. Alternatively, sometimes it might be possible to workaround (B) by moving toolbar items around or rendering them after a short delay.
- On macOS 15.1, Tabs in TabViews that use the .sidebarAdaptable style might not be selected when the Tab label is clicked. (137277517) (FB15383066)
