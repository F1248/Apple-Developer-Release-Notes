### [NSWritingToolsCoordinator](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/macos-release-notes/macos-15_2-release-notes#NSWritingToolsCoordinator)

#### [Resolved Issues](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/macos-release-notes/macos-15_2-release-notes#Resolved-Issues)

- Fixed: `NSWritingToolsCoordinator` ignores the returned attributed string from `writingToolsCoordinator(_:replaceRange:inContext:proposedText:reason:animationParameters:completion:)`. (139210266)

#### [Known Issues](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/macos-release-notes/macos-15_2-release-notes#Known-Issues)

#### [Resolved Issues](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/macos-release-notes/macos-15_2-release-notes#Resolved-Issues)

- Fixed: Compiling in the Swift 6 language mode might cause an `@Entry` error due to “static property `defaultValue` is not concurrency-safe because non-‘Sendable’ type”. (133885814)
