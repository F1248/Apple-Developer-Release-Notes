### [StoreKit](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/macos-release-notes/macos-14_4-release-notes#StoreKit)

#### [New Features](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/macos-release-notes/macos-14_4-release-notes#New-Features)

- `productDescriptionHidden(_:)` API can be used to configure the visibility of product descriptions in `ProductView`, `StoreView` and `SubscriptionStoreView` instances within a view hierarchy. When building with Xcode 15.3, the view modifier can be used even if your app is running on iOS 17.0, iPadOS 17.0, macOS 14.0, tvOS 17.0, watchOS 10.0, visionOS 1.0, or later.

  When implementing a product view style, it can support this new view modifier by checking the `descriptionVisibility` property on the configuration value. (110414819) (FB12261973)
- You can use [`SubscriptionStoreView`](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/storekit/subscriptionstoreview) to present promotional offers by adding the `subscriptionPromotionalOffer(offer:signature:)` modifier.

  If you’re already using [`inAppPurchaseOptions(_:)`](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/swiftui/view/inapppurchaseoptions(_:)) modifier to support promotional offers for StoreKit views, you should adopt the new API instead when your app is running on iOS 17.4, iPadOS 17.4, macOS 14.4, tvOS 17.4, watchOS 10.4, visionOS 1.1 or later. Do not use both APIs to apply a promotional offer for the same view. (115358806)

#### [Resolved Issues](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/macos-release-notes/macos-14_4-release-notes#Resolved-Issues)

- Fixed: The [`isEligibleForIntroOffer`](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/storekit/product/subscriptioninfo/3803203-iseligibleforintrooffer) property and [`isEligibleForIntroOffer(for:)`](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/storekit/product/subscriptioninfo/3791958-iseligibleforintrooffer) method now reflect ineligibility in cases where a customer would otherwise be eligible for the offer if they weren’t actively subscribed. This means a customer which is not currently eligible for an introductory offer may become eligible in the future.

  Customers who redeem an introductory offer for a given subscription group will continue to never be eligible for another introductory offer in that subscription group. You can detect this case this by checking if any one transaction with a matching [`subscriptionGroupID`](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/storekit/transaction/3749718-subscriptiongroupid) has the [`type`](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/storekit/transaction/offer/4307073-type) property on [`offer`](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/storekit/transaction/4307076-offer) set to [`introductory`](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/storekit/transaction/offertype/3822309-introductory). (103604770) (FB11889732)

### [SwiftUI](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/macos-release-notes/macos-14_4-release-notes#SwiftUI)

#### [New Features](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/macos-release-notes/macos-14_4-release-notes#New-Features)

- `Table` now supports dynamic numbers of columns with the new `TableColumnForEach`. (79492167) (FB9189673)

#### [Resolved Issues](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/macos-release-notes/macos-14_4-release-notes#Resolved-Issues)

- Fixed: DatePicker in macOS reset focus to the first date component when its bound date changes and `timeZone` is overriden in the environment. (97376561)

### [Synchronization](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/macos-release-notes/macos-14_4-release-notes#Synchronization)

#### [New Features](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/macos-release-notes/macos-14_4-release-notes#New-Features)

- New `os_sync_wait_on_address` APIs have been added. They are expected to be used for implementing synchronization primitives that do not have a sense of ownership. Please file feedback if you need Synchronization functionality not covered by existing API. (94759935) (FB10141068)
