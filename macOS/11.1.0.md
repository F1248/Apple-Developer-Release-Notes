#### [Known Issues](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/macos-release-notes/macos-big-sur-11_1-release-notes#Known-Issues)

- When you present a view controller with page sheet or form sheet presentation style, the size of the view controller’s root view is, by default, determined by the value returned from the presented view controller’s [`preferredContentSize`](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/UIKit/UIViewController/preferredContentSize) method and the view is not resizable. You can arrange for the presented view controller to be resizable by using Auto Layout to specify the maximum and minimum sizes of its root view. To enable this, set the [`canResizeToFitContent`](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/UIKit/UIWindow/canResizeToFitContent) property of the application’s main window to YES. One way to do this is to override the [`willMove(toWindow:)`](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/UIKit/UIView/willMove(toWindow:)) or [`didMoveToWindow()`](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/UIKit/UIView/didMoveToWindow()) methods of a view in the main view controller. (65254666)

  For example:

  ```
  - (void)willMoveToWindow:(UIWindow *)newWindow {
      [super willMoveToWindow:newWindow];
      newWindow.canResizeToFitContent = YES;
  }

  ```
