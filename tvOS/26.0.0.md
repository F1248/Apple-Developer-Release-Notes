# tvOS 26 Beta 5 Release Notes

Update your apps to use new features, and test your apps against API changes.

## [Overview](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/tvos-release-notes/tvos-26-release-notes#Overview)

The tvOS 26 SDK provides support to develop tvOS apps for Apple TV devices running tvOS 26 beta 5. The SDK comes bundled with Xcode 26, available from the Mac App Store. For information on the compatibility requirements for Xcode 26, see [Xcode 26 Release Notes](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/Xcode-Release-Notes/xcode-26-release-notes).

### [App Store](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/tvos-release-notes/tvos-26-release-notes#App-Store)

#### [New Features](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/tvos-release-notes/tvos-26-release-notes#New-Features)

- A new Accessibility section has been added to the App Store product pages that highlights accessibility features within apps and games. These Accessibility Nutrition Labels give users a new way to learn if an app will be accessible to them before they download it, and give developers the opportunity to better inform and educate their users on features their app supports. (138344118)

### [Apple Intelligence](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/tvos-release-notes/tvos-26-release-notes#Apple-Intelligence)

#### [Resolved Issues](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/tvos-release-notes/tvos-26-release-notes#Resolved-Issues)

- Fixed: Model quality output degrades after extended, repeated inferences of the same adapter. (152468267)

### [Apple TV](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/tvos-release-notes/tvos-26-release-notes#Apple-TV)

#### [Resolved Issues](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/tvos-release-notes/tvos-26-release-notes#Resolved-Issues)

- Fixed: Apple TV might fail to authorize and attempt to launch a properly signed app that is being run immediately after installation from Xcode, with a spurious error indicating that the Developer App certificate needs to be trusted on the device. (154812309)

### [AssistantSchemas](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/tvos-release-notes/tvos-26-release-notes#AssistantSchemas)

#### [Resolved Issues](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/tvos-release-notes/tvos-26-release-notes#Resolved-Issues)

- Fixed: If you have adopted any of the following email AssistantSchemas, you will experience a compilation error due to a parameter type change: `createDraft`, `updateDraft`, `replyMail`, `forwardMail`, `message`, and `draft`. (148633307)

### [AVFoundation](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/tvos-release-notes/tvos-26-release-notes#AVFoundation)

#### [Resolved Issues](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/tvos-release-notes/tvos-26-release-notes#Resolved-Issues)

- Fixed: `AVPlayerLayer` does not ensure a valid video frame is always displayed during item replacement, as the `isReadyForDisplay` property does not remain true during transitions. (151902458)

### [Background Assets](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/tvos-release-notes/tvos-26-release-notes#Background-Assets)

#### [Resolved Issues](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/tvos-release-notes/tvos-26-release-notes#Resolved-Issues)

- Fixed: The system might not update downloaded asset packs as frequently as is expected for apps that internal testers install from TestFlight. (143281558)
- Fixed: Asset pack downloads might fail unexpectedly or stall indefinitely, including across reboots. (151498902)
- Fixed: The system might not deliver status updates to your app for ongoing asset pack downloads. (151647839)
- Fixed: Pausing and resuming an app installation or update while the system is downloading essential asset packs might cause the installation or update to stall indefinitely. (151942388)
- Fixed: Settings for Development Overrides are unavailable on tvOS. (152131750)
- Fixed: The installation of large asset packs might fail. (153128086)
- Fixed: The URL Override setting doesn’t save an entered URL’s port number. The device always attempts to communicate with the mock server over port 443. (156113742) (FB18913475)

### [CoreData](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/tvos-release-notes/tvos-26-release-notes#CoreData)

#### [Known Issues](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/tvos-release-notes/tvos-26-release-notes#Known-Issues)

- In beta 5 SDK, CoreData changed several `Sendable` annotations to resolve compatibility issues with Swift 6’s new `MainActor` default isolation feature. These changes include marking `NSManagedObject` as `NS_SWIFT_NONISOLATED NS_SWIFT_NONSENDABLE`, marking `NSManagedObjectContext` as `NS_SWIFT_NONISOLATED NS_SWIFT_SENDABLE`, and requiring `NS_SWIFT_SENDABLE` closures for the family of `perform`, `performBlock`, `performBlockAndWait` and similar methods. These changes are ABI compatible with past releases but might introduce new warnings while building source code that violates the longstanding CoreData concurrency guidelines.

  `NSManagedObject` are mutable reference types inextricably related to others in a graph and cannot be made `Sendable`. They are expected to be isolated to the scope of the `NSManagedObjectContext` that creates or fetches them. `NSManagedObjectContext` is a style of actor which encapsulates its own dispatch queue. While it’s impermissible to use many methods on `NSManagedObjectContext` from other threads, it is permissible to pass references around to invoke the `performBlock` family of methods, for the purpose of routing a `Sendable` closure to its managed dispatch queue. CoreData supports a user default `-com.apple.CoreData.ConcurrencyDebug 1` which can be used to enable additional assertions. (153848710) (FB18216198)

  **Workaround:** Most new warnings detected by Swift from these changes are real data races, although some errors are not properly downgraded to warnings as the `@preconcurrency` attribute would indicate. To work around this, apply a `nonisolated(unsafe)` closure local to errors involving `MainActor` isolated state captured by a `performBlock` closure:

  ```
               nonisolated(unsafe) let perform = {
                   // work
               }
               
               try context.performAndWait {
                 try perform()
               }

  ```

### [Fitness+](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/tvos-release-notes/tvos-26-release-notes#Fitness+)

#### [Known Issues](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/tvos-release-notes/tvos-26-release-notes#Known-Issues)

- Fitness+ might crash when attempting to use Search. (157146534)

### [Foundation](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/tvos-release-notes/tvos-26-release-notes#Foundation)

#### [New Features](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/tvos-release-notes/tvos-26-release-notes#New-Features)

- Interpolating non-localized types into a `LocalizedStringResource/String(localized:)/AttributedString(localized:)` value will now display a deprecation warning instead of potentially falling back to a fully-unlocalized string. Provide a localized value to interpolate into the text instead, or silence the warning by wrapping the unlocalized value in a call to `String(describing:)`. (126876158)

#### [Resolved Issues](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/tvos-release-notes/tvos-26-release-notes#Resolved-Issues)

- Fixed: Functions that initialize a string from a C-string pointer do not validate that the provided encoding is a valid encoding for C-strings. (143756086) (FB16417968)
- Fixed: `Locale.preferredLocale` API availability for tvOS and watchOS is specified incorrectly. (151205096)

### [Game Controller](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/tvos-release-notes/tvos-26-release-notes#Game-Controller)

#### [New Features](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/tvos-release-notes/tvos-26-release-notes#New-Features)

- Pair multiple Apple devices to your DualSense or DualSense Edge controller and easily switch between them directly using the controller or Bluetooth settings. See [this PlayStation blog post](https://blog.playstation.com/2025/07/23/new-ps5-system-update-beta-previews-dualsense-wireless-controller-pairing-across-multiple-devices/) for details. (137782227)

### [Metal](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/tvos-release-notes/tvos-26-release-notes#Metal)

#### [New Features](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/tvos-release-notes/tvos-26-release-notes#New-Features)

- Metal 4 is now supported. See [Metal](https://developer.apple.com/metal/) for additional details. (113781091)

#### [Resolved Issues](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/tvos-release-notes/tvos-26-release-notes#Resolved-Issues)

- Fixed: If you’re using Metal 4 command encoders, you should add render and compute pipelines that support indirect command buffers to your residency sets. The Metal device driver currently does not enforce this requirement. (145066238)
- Fixed: Metal Shader Validation might not work with shaders that use Metal Performance Primitives. (149263281)

#### [Known Issues](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/tvos-release-notes/tvos-26-release-notes#Known-Issues)

- Metal Shader Validation might not work with Metal 4 ray tracing pipelines. (152520367)

  **Workaround:** Selectively disable Shader Validation for pipelines using ray tracing. See [documentation](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/xcode/validating-your-apps-metal-shader-usage/#Selectively-enable-Shader-Validation).

### [MetalFX](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/tvos-release-notes/tvos-26-release-notes#MetalFX)

#### [Resolved Issues](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/tvos-release-notes/tvos-26-release-notes#Resolved-Issues)

- Fixed: Temporal upscaling for MTL4CommandBuffer’s `MTL4FXTemporalScaler` does not work. (146436741)

### [NSLog](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/tvos-release-notes/tvos-26-release-notes#NSLog)

#### [New Features](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/tvos-release-notes/tvos-26-release-notes#New-Features)

- Dynamic string data in format arguments for `NSLog` will be redacted to `\<private\>` in the Unified Logging System. This specifically targets data that enters the Unified Logging System via `NSLog`, and will not impact the Xcode console or `NSLog`’s `stdout` output. If you wish to log un-redacted data to the Unified Logging System please use the “os\_log” or “Logger” interfaces. (137129180)

### [Playback](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/tvos-release-notes/tvos-26-release-notes#Playback)

#### [Resolved Issues](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/tvos-release-notes/tvos-26-release-notes#Resolved-Issues)

- Fixed: AirPlay to Stereo Pair might not work after a group is created or removed from Home Theater setup in the Home app. (152107026)

### [RealityKit](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/tvos-release-notes/tvos-26-release-notes#RealityKit)

#### [Resolved Issues](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/tvos-release-notes/tvos-26-release-notes#Resolved-Issues)

- Fixed: `ParticleEmitterComponent` does not render properly on iOS, macOS, and tvOS. (152201501)
- Fixed: The `animate` functions on `Entity` and `RealityViewContent` do not start animations. (152456435)

#### [Known Issues](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/tvos-release-notes/tvos-26-release-notes#Known-Issues)

- Some properties and components do not update SwiftUI Views when accessed through the `.observable` property on Entity. (147063698)
- The `entity(at:in:)` function on RealityViewCameraContent does not work correctly on tvOS. (148920446)
- The following ShaderGraph nodes are not supported on all Apple TV models. See your device’s MTLGPUFamily enum for details.

  These nodes require Apple3:

  - RealityKitTexture2DArray
  - RealityKitTexture2DArrayGradient
  - RealityKitTexture2DArrayLOD
  - RealityKitTexture2DArrayPixel
  - RealityKitTexture2DArrayPixelGradient
  - RealityKitTexture2DArrayPixelLOD
  - RealityKitTexture2DArrayRead

  These nodes require Apple4:

  - RealityKitImageInfo\_texturecube
  - RealityKitTextureCube
  - RealityKitTextureCubeGradient
  - RealityKitTextureCubeLOD

  These nodes require Apple6 and tier2 Argument Buffers:

  - RealityKitImageInfo\_texture3d
  - RealityKitTexture3D
  - RealityKitTexture3DGradient
  - RealityKitTexture3DLOD
  - RealityKitTexture3DPixel
  - RealityKitTexture3DPixelGradient
  - RealityKitTexture3DPixelLOD
  - RealityKitTexture3DRead (151498365)

  **Workaround:** Make a dedicated ShaderGraph material for these devices.

### [Security](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/tvos-release-notes/tvos-26-release-notes#Security)

#### [Deprecations](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/tvos-release-notes/tvos-26-release-notes#Deprecations)

- For apps linked on or after iOS 26 and macOS 26, the default minimum TLS version of `URLSession` and Network frameworks has changed from 1.0 to 1.2. If your process connects only to your servers, verify that they support TLS 1.3 or TLS 1.2. If your process needs to connect to 3rd-party servers which cannot be updated to support newer versions of TLS, restore the previous behavior through `URLSession` and Security framework APIs: `URLSessionConfiguration.tlsMinimumSupportedProtocolVersion` and `sec_protocol_options_set_min_tls_protocol_version`. (135996267)

### [Speech](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/tvos-release-notes/tvos-26-release-notes#Speech)

#### [Known Issues](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/tvos-release-notes/tvos-26-release-notes#Known-Issues)

- The `Speech` framework is not available in the tvOS or watchOS SDKs. (151319670)

### [StoreKit](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/tvos-release-notes/tvos-26-release-notes#StoreKit)

#### [New Features](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/tvos-release-notes/tvos-26-release-notes#New-Features)

- There is a new option for the `Transaction.Offer.PaymentMode` API called `oneTime`. This new case supports the method of payment for In-App Purchase offer codes. (142501142)
- Subscription promotional offers can now be signed using JWS and attached to a purchase using the new `PurchaseOption.promotionalOffer(_:compactJWS:)` API. There are also new corresponding SwiftUI APIs in StoreKit to attach a signed promotional offer or a signed introductory offer override to a view. (143395736)

#### [Resolved Issues](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/tvos-release-notes/tvos-26-release-notes#Resolved-Issues)

- Fixed: Subscription status updates might not be reported correctly if the subscription went into billing retry in StoreKit Testing in Xcode. (133799135) (FB14789854)
- Fixed: Price of offers is not displayed in the payment sheet when making a purchase to a subscription with a higher level of service in StoreKit Testing in Xcode. (140635780) (FB15980635)
- Fixed: Renewal transactions might be created regardless of the Ask to Buy status of the purchase request in StoreKit Testing in Xcode. (145242611)
- Fixed: `SKProduct` from the original StoreKit API fails to decode products when using StoreKit Testing in Xcode. (150851879)
- Fixed: Transactions might not finish, resulting in subsequent purchases of the same product failing. (155449267)

### [Swift Charts](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/tvos-release-notes/tvos-26-release-notes#Swift-Charts)

#### [Resolved Issues](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/tvos-release-notes/tvos-26-release-notes#Resolved-Issues)

- Fixed: Annotations on a scrollable chart might be clipped. (109164195)

### [SwiftUI](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/tvos-release-notes/tvos-26-release-notes#SwiftUI)

#### [New Features](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/tvos-release-notes/tvos-26-release-notes#New-Features)

- `ControlSize` now conforms to `Comparable`, and `View/controlSize(_:)` can now be used to clamp the environment’s `controlSize` to a given range. (99633360) (FB11465757)
- Text, TextEditor, and TextField now by default use string contents to determine the appropriate base writing direction for each paragraph, instead of relying on layout directionality. To specify the writing direction explicitly on a per-paragraph basis, use Foundation’s `AttributedString.writingDirection` attribute. To make the base writing direction follow the layout direction for an entire view, apply the view modifier `.writingDirection(strategy: .layoutBased)`. (134821288)
- When linking news SDKs, `NavigationLink`s produce a single view, rather than a list of views in view list contexts. This change improves performance of many `NavigationLink`s in lazy containers like `List`. However, if you are relying on `ContainerValues` propagating out of the `label` view of a `NavigationLink`, or similarly relying on `ContainerValues` of a `ButtonStyle` used to style a link, the `containerValue(_:,_:)` modifier should be moved outside of the link. Below is a minimal example that demonstrates the behavior difference:

  ```
   import SwiftUI
   
   struct ContentView: View {
       @State private var presentPopover = false
       var body: some View {
           NavigationLink("Custom Link", value: 84)
               .buttonStyle(MyButtonStyle(containerValue: "Eighty-four"))
       }
   }
   
   struct ParentView: View {
       var body: some View {
           Group(subviews: ContentView()) { subviews in
               ForEach(subviews) { subview in
                   Text(subview.containerValues.myCustomValue)
               }
           }
           .frame(minWidth: 100, minHeight: 100)
       }
   }
   
   struct MyButtonStyle: PrimitiveButtonStyle {
       var containerValue: String
       func makeBody(configuration: Configuration) -> some View {
           Button(configuration)
               .buttonBorderShape(.circle)
               .containerValue(\.myCustomValue, containerValue)
       }
   }
   
   private struct MyContainerValueKey: ContainerValueKey {
       static let defaultValue: String = "Default value"
   }
   
   extension ContainerValues {
       var myCustomValue: String {
           get { self[MyContainerValueKey.self] }
           set { self[MyContainerValueKey.self] = newValue }
       }
   }
   
   #Preview {
       ParentView()
   }

  ```

  (140283584)
- `List` no longer ignores the vertical insets of rows with a height close to the default minimum height on iOS and visionOS. Use `listRowInsets(_:_:)` to change the vertical row insets. (141160852)
- In `NavigationSplitView` and `TabView`s configured as `sidebarAdaptable`, the view trailing the sidebar’s safe area is inset in the width of the sidebar. It can display content outside its safe area, underneath the sidebar. (141222137)
- You can now adapt your custom views in tvOS with `ControlSize`, `View/controlSize(_:)`, and `EnvironmentValues/controlSize`. (145237287)
- In apps that adopt the new design, the `buttonBorderShape(_:)` view modifier can be used to customize the shape of bordered buttons. Previously this modifier only affected buttons in Widgets in macOS. (145773436)
- The `buttonSizing(_:)` view modifier specifies the sizing behavior of `Button`, `Picker`, `Menu`, and other button-producing controls. If you are using `Spacer` views or an infinite-width frame in your `Button` label to create a flexible button, apply `buttonSizing(.flexible)` to the `Button` instead. (146327046)

#### [Resolved Issues](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/tvos-release-notes/tvos-26-release-notes#Resolved-Issues)

- Fixed: `TextEditor`’s undo stack might contain invalid operations for applications with multiple `TextEditor` views. (83650197) (FB9662463)
- Fixed: The menu content of some `Menu` views does not update as the result of a state change. (106878937)
- Fixed: [`View.onHover(perform:)`](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/swiftui/view/onhover(perform:)) and [`View.onContinuousHover(coordinateSpace:perform:)`](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/swiftui/view/oncontinuoushover(coordinatespace:perform:)) affect hit-testing for gestures. Gestures are not received if one of these view modifiers is used within an overlay. (108560020)
- Fixed: Section views without `isExpanded` binding are collapsible in a sidebar-styled List on macOS. (115797465) (FB13192271)
- Fixed: `listSectionSpacing` does not work correctly for sections that have headers and footers. For more control over the list section layout, use the `listSectionMargins` modifier. (140929163)
- Fixed: On iOS, `navigationSplitViewColumnWidth()` does not respect the specified minimum and maximum column widths. (143529326)
- Fixed: Multiple title views in sidebar list labels on iOS are not styled hierarchically as title and subtitle. (144253754)
- Fixed: In custom layouts that do not implement `explicitAlignment(of:in:proposal:subviews:cache:)`, alignment guides do not work correctly for a right-to-left layout direction. (145073832)
- Fixed: Applying a `bold` modifier to `Text` resets the `weight` configuration. The interaction of `bold` and `weight` is not consistent between Text and Font. (147270079)
- Fixed: On platforms supporting edge-attached and non-edge-attached sheets, non-edge-attached sheets present erroneously as full-screen covers when `.navigationTransition(.zoom...)` is specified. If you wish to keep the full-screen cover in compact size classes, configure a sheet with:

  ```
   .sheet(...) {
      ContentView()
       .navigationTransition(.zoom...)
       .presentationSizing(.page)
       .presentationCompactAdaptation(.fullScreen)

  ```

  (150455117)
- Fixed: If Default Actor Isolation is set to `MainActor`, `@Animatable` macro emits concurrency warnings in Swift 5 language mode and does not compile in Swift 6 language mode. (152524435)
- Fixed: Gestures do not have the same lower priority over the view’s existing `UIGestureRecognizer`s and `NSGestureRecognizer`s as they do over the view’s existing SwiftUI gestures.

  In apps built with iOS 26, macOS 26, tvOS 26, and visionOS 26, use [`highPriorityGesture(_:isEnabled:)`](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/swiftui/view/highprioritygesture(_:isenabled:)) to make sure your gesture takes precedence over the view’s existing gestures, or use [`simultaneousGesture(_:isEnabled:)`](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/swiftui/view/simultaneousgesture(_:isenabled:)) to give your gesture the same priority as the view’s existing gestures. (155581361)

#### [Deprecations](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/tvos-release-notes/tvos-26-release-notes#Deprecations)

- `Text` concatenation using the `+` operator is deprecated because it makes it hard to create localized strings that are correct across all languages. Use `Text` interpolation instead. See documentation on `Text` for more info on how to produce localized strings. (128144043)

### [SwiftUI and UIKit](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/tvos-release-notes/tvos-26-release-notes#SwiftUI-and-UIKit)

#### [Known Issues](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/tvos-release-notes/tvos-26-release-notes#Known-Issues)

- Design updates in tvOS 26 are not carried forward to Apple TV 4K (1st generation) and older models. The updates are only testable on Apple TV 4K 2nd and 3rd generation models. (152111626)

### [TextKit](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/tvos-release-notes/tvos-26-release-notes#TextKit)

#### [New Features](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/tvos-release-notes/tvos-26-release-notes#New-Features)

- iOS 26, tvOS 26, visionOS 26, watchOS 26, and macOS Tahoe 26 have two methods for resolving the natural alignment `NSTextAlignment.natural` and the last line of `NSTextAlignment.justified` into concrete alignments, `left` and `right`. The first approach utilizes the UI language, which is determined by passing nil-language to `NSParagraphStyle.defaultWritingDirection(forLanguage: )`. This behavior was employed prior to this release. The second method is new and dynamically utilizes the base writing direction for the paragraph. When the base writing direction is set to `NSWritingDirection.rightToLeft`, the text is aligned to `right`, and vice versa. The behavior is selected by API introduced in this major release: `NSTextLayoutManager.resolvesNaturalAlignmentWithBaseWritingDirection`, `NSStringDrawingOptionsResolvesNaturalAlignmentWithBaseWritingDirection`, `UITraitCollection.resolvesNaturalAlignmentWithBaseWritingDirection`, and `NSTextField.resolvesNaturalAlignmentWithBaseWritingDirection`. (152045248)

#### [Resolved Issues](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/tvos-release-notes/tvos-26-release-notes#Resolved-Issues)

- Fixed: The directionality of `NSParagraphStyle` indentation properties (`firstLineHeadIndent`, `headIndent`, and `tailIndent`) is determined by inconsistent hidden rules implemented by the TextKit typesetting engine.

  With iOS 26, macOS 26, tvOS 26, watchOS 26, and visionOS 26, the TextKit 2 typesetting engine has been standardized to utilize the resolved writing direction for the paragraph when linked with the OS 26 versions of the corresponding SDKs. For binary compatibility, applications developed with prior SDK versions will use the UI language in a subset of API interfaces. Specifically, for `UILabel`, `NSTextField`, `SwiftUI.Text`, and `NSStringDrawing`, the indentation directionality is determined by the UI language queried by passing nil to `NSParagraphStyle. defaultWritingDirection()` in applications built with prior SDK versions. (155893102)

### [UIKit](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/tvos-release-notes/tvos-26-release-notes#UIKit)

#### [Deprecations](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/tvos-release-notes/tvos-26-release-notes#Deprecations)

- `UIScreen.mainScreen` has been changed from `API_TO_BE_DEPRECATED` to deprecated in iOS 26, tvOS 26, and visionOS 26. (142902390)

### [Virtualization](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/tvos-release-notes/tvos-26-release-notes#Virtualization)

#### [Known Issues](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/tvos-release-notes/tvos-26-release-notes#Known-Issues)

- You might encounter an issue when changing the MTU size of the logical network with which VZVmnetNetworkDeviceAttachment is initialized. (152170606)

  **Workaround:** Use the default MTU size instead of customizing it when creating the logical network through the vmnet framework.
