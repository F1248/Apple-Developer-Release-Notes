- `NSExpression` immediately forbids certain operations that have significant side effects, like creating and destroying objects. Additionally, casting string class names into Class objects with `NSConstantValueExpression` is deprecated. (84017178)

  **Workaround:** Pass temporary objects to `NSExpression` in the context parameter of [`expressionValueWithObject:context:`](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/foundation/nsexpression/1410363-expressionvaluewithobject), or with `NSPredicate` as the `substitutionVariables` parameter of [`evaluateWithObject:substitutionVariables:`](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/foundation/nspredicate/1407759-evaluatewithobject). You can create a derived predicate with all the substitution variables replaced (bound), using [`withSubstitutionVariables(_:)`](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/foundation/nspredicate/1413227-withsubstitutionvariables) on an existing `NSPredicate` so that code using the object can continue to use a simple `evaluate(with object: Any?)` invocation.
