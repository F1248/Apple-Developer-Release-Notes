# Xcode 26 Beta 4 Release Notes

Update your apps to use new features, and test your apps against API changes.

## [Overview](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/xcode-release-notes/xcode-26-release-notes#Overview)

Xcode 26 beta 4 includes SDKs for iOS 26, iPadOS 26, tvOS 26, watchOS 26, macOS Tahoe 26, and visionOS 26. The Xcode 26 beta 4 release supports on-device debugging in iOS 16 and later, tvOS 16 and later, watchOS 8 and later, and visionOS. Xcode 26 beta 4 requires a Mac running macOS Sequoia 15.5 or later.

### [General](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/xcode-release-notes/xcode-26-release-notes#General)

#### [Known Issues](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/xcode-release-notes/xcode-26-release-notes#Known-Issues)

- The `span` property of `UTF8View` does not support the small string representation in beta 1, and traps for small `String` instances. A future version of the Swift standard library will lift this restriction. (137710901)

  **Workaround:** As a workaround, reserve capacity for 16 UTF8 code units, which forces the `String` to use another representation.

  ```
   var string = "small"
   // _ = string.utf8.span     // this would trap!
   string.reserveCapacity(16)
   let span = string.utf8.span // no problem
   assert(span[2] == 97)

  ```
- The Related Items menu has been simplified to items to improve editor load times. Assistant Categories like Callers are still available in the Assistant Editor. There is also similar functionality available via editor context menus or in the Find Navigator. (147335052)
- Simulators may fail to boot during the first build after upgrading macOS; rebuilding after a short wait typically resolves the issue. (152328794)
- Sometimes the “Cancel” button in the Coding Assistant status bar fails to stop the currently executing message. (152546155)

  **Workaround:** Use the Coding Assistant navigator directly, and click “Cancel”.
- To mimic Xcode 16 tab behavior use these settings: Xcode -> Settings -> Navigation -> Pin Tabs -> When Document Is Edited View > Show Editor Tab Bar (153670772) (FB18158843)
- In Settings > Navigation, Option+Click and Option+Shift+Click can be configured to Use New Unpinned Tab or Use New Pinned Tab (154324695)

### [App Intents](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/xcode-release-notes/xcode-26-release-notes#App-Intents)

#### [Known Issues](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/xcode-release-notes/xcode-26-release-notes#Known-Issues)

- User supplied background images in Icon Composer are composited at the same scale as the 2048x2048 pixel icon renderings, and thus appear much smaller than expected. (148133443)

  **Workaround:** Use a very large background image.
- Exporting a single PNG, or using the “Copy Icon as Image” menu item, for Clear Light, Clear Dark, Tinted Light, or Tinted Dark will produce an unexpected dark image. (148998556)

  **Workaround:** Use the export all functionality from the export sheet.

### [Instruments](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/xcode-release-notes/xcode-26-release-notes#Instruments)

#### [New Features](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/xcode-release-notes/xcode-26-release-notes#New-Features)

- Fixed: You may experience build failures when building projects with Swift macro dependencies. Common symptom is a build failure around `_SwiftSyntaxCShims`. You can work around this by disabling the swift-syntax prebuilts for macros feature. Quit Xcode. Issue the command `defaults write com.apple.dt.Xcode IDEPackageEnablePrebuilts NO` at the command line. Clean out the DerivedData for the project in `~/Library/Developer/Xcode/DerivedData`. Restart Xcode and execute the build. (152253497)

#### [Known Issues](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/xcode-release-notes/xcode-26-release-notes#Known-Issues)

- In a project that uses macros and when using the Legacy Preview Execution for Canvas, builds will fail when building for preview. You can work around this by disabling the swift-syntax prebuilts for macros feature. Quit Xcode. Issue the command `defaults write com.apple.dt.Xcode IDEPackageEnablePrebuilts NO` at the command line. Clean out the DerivedData for the project in `~/Library/Developer/Xcode/DerivedData`. Restart Xcode and execute the build. (152443472)

- Fixed: Using a Swift.org toolchain in Xcode may cause build errors in targets that use Swift Testing due to an incompatible macro plugin being selected. (151799859)

#### [Known Issues](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/xcode-release-notes/xcode-26-release-notes#Known-Issues)

- Swift Testing exit tests may produce crash logs in /Library/. (47982238)
- Attachments are not recorded from within the bodies of exit tests when using Swift Testing. (149242118)
- Swift Testing tests and suites whose names use raw identifiers (introduced in [SE-0451: Raw identifiers](https://github.com/swiftlang/swift-evolution/blob/main/proposals/0451-escaped-identifiers.md)) cannot be run selectively via Xcode’s Test navigator or source editor diamonds, and cannot be included or excluded in test plans. (152524780)

  **Workaround:** Choose “Product > Test” to run all tests, or avoid using raw identifiers for affected tests and suites.

## [Updates in Xcode 26 Beta](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/xcode-release-notes/xcode-26-release-notes#Updates-in-Xcode-26-Beta)

### [General](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/xcode-release-notes/xcode-26-release-notes#General)

#### [New Features in Xcode 26 Beta](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/xcode-release-notes/xcode-26-release-notes#New-Features-in-Xcode-26-Beta)

- Added a new setting that dictates how function names are displayed in C++ frames: plugin.cplusplus.display.function-name-format

  By default this displays the entirety of a function name, but can be customized to drop various parts of a function signature (e.g., return type, scope qualifiers, etc.). See https://lldb.llvm.org/use/formatting.html#function-name-formats for more details.

  By default LLDB will now highlight the function basename when displayed in C++ frames (e.g., in the backtrace). (150174227)

#### [Resolved Issues in Xcode 26 Beta](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/xcode-release-notes/xcode-26-release-notes#Resolved-Issues-in-Xcode-26-Beta)

- Fixed: The alert shown when a file, project, or workspace is modified by a different program while also opened in Xcode had inconsistent button labeling, and the default action did not always keep the Xcode version of the file. (86281699)

### [AssistantSchemas](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/xcode-release-notes/xcode-26-release-notes#AssistantSchemas)

#### [Resolved Issues in Xcode 26 Beta](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/xcode-release-notes/xcode-26-release-notes#Resolved-Issues-in-Xcode-26-Beta)

- Fixed: If you have adopted any of the following email AssistantSchemas, you will experience a compilation error due to a parameter type change: `createDraft`, `updateDraft`, `replyMail`, `forwardMail`, `message`, and `draft`. (148633307)

### [Background Assets](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/xcode-release-notes/xcode-26-release-notes#Background-Assets)

- Fixed: The packaging tool (`ba-package`) and the mock server (`ba-serve`) crash immediately when the selected Xcode installation isn’t located at `/Applications/Xcode.app`. (148927743)

### [Build System](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/xcode-release-notes/xcode-26-release-notes#Build-System)

#### [New Features in Xcode 26 Beta](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/xcode-release-notes/xcode-26-release-notes#New-Features-in-Xcode-26-Beta)

- Compilation caching has been introduced as an opt-in feature, which speeds-up iterative build/test cycles for Swift and C-family languages. The compilation caching feature caches the results of compilations that were produced for a set of source files inputs and, when it detects that the same set of source files are getting re-compiled, it speeds-up the build by providing the prior compilation results directly from the cache. The workflows that will benefit the most from compilation caching are when switching between branches (which ends up re-compiling the same source files again) or when doing clean builds.

  Compilation caching can be enabled via “Enable Compilation Caching” build setting or via the per-user project settings. (149700201)

#### [Resolved Issues in Xcode 26 Beta](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/xcode-release-notes/xcode-26-release-notes#Resolved-Issues-in-Xcode-26-Beta)

- Fixed: When using synchronized group folders, the file order was non-deterministic, causing unnecessary rebuilds of the target from `xcodebuild` or after re-opening the Xcode project. (151472630)

### [C++ Standard Library](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/xcode-release-notes/xcode-26-release-notes#C++-Standard-Library)

#### [New Features in Xcode 26 Beta](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/xcode-release-notes/xcode-26-release-notes#New-Features-in-Xcode-26-Beta)

- The following C++26 features have been implemented:

  - `constexpr` placement new ([P2747R2](https://wg21.link/P2747R2)) ([Github](https://github.com/llvm/llvm-project/issues/105427))
  - A type trait for detecting virtual base classes ([P2985R0](https://wg21.link/P2985R0)) ([Github](https://github.com/llvm/llvm-project/issues/105432))

  The following C++23 features have been implemented:

  - Relaxing Ranges Just A Smidge ([P2609R3](https://wg21.link/P2609R3)) ([Github](https://github.com/llvm/llvm-project/issues/105253))
  - A trait for implicit lifetime types ([P2674R1](https://wg21.link/P2674R1)) ([Github](https://github.com/llvm/llvm-project/issues/105259))
  - A Standard `flat_map` ([P0429R9](https://wg21.link/P0429R9)) ([Github](https://github.com/llvm/llvm-project/issues/105190))

  The following C++20 features have been implemented:

  - Reviewing Deprecated Facilities of C++17 for C++20 ([P0619R4](https://wg21.link/P0619R4)) ([Github](https://github.com/llvm/llvm-project/issues/99985))

  Performance and memory improvements:

  - The `lexicographical_compare` and `ranges::lexicographical_compare` algorithms have been optimized for trivially equality comparable types, resulting in a performance improvement of up to 40x.
  - The internal structure `__compressed_pair` has been replaced with `[[no_unique_address]]`, resulting in reduced compile times and smaller debug information as well as better code generation if optimizations are disabled.
  - The `input_iterator`-pair overload of `void assign(InputIt, InputIt)` has been optimized for `std::vector`, resulting in a performance improvement of up to 2x for trivial element types (e.g., `std::vector<int>`), and up to 3.4x for non-trivial element types (e.g., `std::vector<std::vector<int>>`).
  - The `input_iterator`-pair overload of `iterator insert(const_iterator, InputIt, InputIt)` has been optimized for `std::vector`, resulting in a performance improvement of up to 10x for `std::vector<int>`, and up to 2.3x for `std::vector<std::vector<int>>`.
  - `std::stable_sort` uses radix sort for integral types now, which can improve the performance up to 10 times, depending on type of sorted elements and the initial state of the sorted array.
  - Reduced the amount of debug information generated for internal typedefs. This reduces the size of debug builds.

  Hardened libc++ related improvements:

  - The `_LIBCPP_ABI_BOUNDED_ITERATORS_IN_STD_ARRAY` ABI configuration was added, which allows storing valid bounds in `std::array::iterator` and detecting OOB accesses when the appropriate hardening mode is enabled.
  - The `_LIBCPP_ABI_BOUNDED_UNIQUE_PTR` ABI configuration was added, which allows `std::unique_ptr<T[]>` to detect out-of-bounds accesses in certain circumstances. `std::unique_ptr<T[]>` can now also detect out-of-bounds accesses for a limited set of types (non-trivially destructible types) when the ABI configuration is disabled.
  - Added ([hardening mode](https://libcxx.llvm.org/Hardening.html#hardening)) support for `forward_list` and `bitset`.

  General Improvements:

  - `std::jthread` and `<stop_token>` are not guarded behind `-fexperimental-library` anymore
  - The `_LIBCPP_ENABLE_CXX20_REMOVED_TEMPORARY_BUFFER` macro has been added to make `std::get_temporary_buffer` and `std::return_temporary_buffer` available.
  - The `std::uncaught_exception` function was marked as deprecated since C++17 and removed since C++20. The `_LIBCPP_ENABLE_CXX20_REMOVED_UNCAUGHT_EXCEPTION` macro has been added to make `std::uncaught_exception` available in C++20 and later modes.

  ABI Affecting Changes:

  - The ABI breaks for removing undefined behaviour in `std::forward_list`, `std::list`, `std::map`, `std::set`, `std::multimap`, `std::multiset`, `std::unordered_map`, `std::unordered_set`, `std::unordered_multimap` and `std::unordered_multiset` are now applied unconditionally. This only affects fancy pointers which have a different value representation when pointing at the base of an internal node type instead of the type itself. A size or alignment difference is diagnosed, but more subtle ABI breaks may result in unexpected behaviour.
  - The internal structure `__compressed_pair` has been replaced with `[[no_unique_address]]`. The ABI impact is:
  - When using the Itanium ABI (most non-MSVC platforms), empty types are now placed at the beginning of the enclosing object instead of where the beginning of the `__compressed_pair` subobject was. This is only observable by checking the address of the empty allocator, equality comparator or hasher.
  - Additionally, using an overaligned empty type as an allocator, comparator or hasher in the associative containers (and only those containers) may result in the container’s object object size and data layout changing beyond only the address of the empty member.

    - The changes for `ranges::zip_view` from ([P2165R4](https://wg21.link/P2165R4)) have been implemented. This changes the element type of `zip_view` from a `std::pair` to a `std::tuple` in some cases. This is technically an ABI break, however since `zip_view` is generally not an ABI sensitive type, we don’t expect users to encounter any issues and we don’t provide a way to change this behavior, which would make libc++ non-conforming. (151879824)

#### [Deprecations in Xcode 26 Beta](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/xcode-release-notes/xcode-26-release-notes#Deprecations-in-Xcode-26-Beta)

- The following items have been deprecated or removed:

  - The `_LIBCPP_ENABLE_ASSERTIONS` macro that were used to enable the safe mode have been removed in LLVM 20. Please use ([support for hardening](https://libcxx.llvm.org/Hardening.html#hardening)) instead.
  - Support for the C++20 synchronization library (`<barrier>`, `<latch>`, `atomic::wait`, etc.) has been removed in language modes prior to C++20. If you are using these features prior to C++20, you will need to update to `-std=c++20`.
  - The relational operators for `std::chrono::weekday` have been removed entirely, and the `_LIBCPP_ENABLE_REMOVED_WEEKDAY_RELATIONAL_OPERATORS` macro is now ignored.
  - The `_LIBCPP_ENABLE_REMOVED_ALLOCATOR_CONST` macro no longer has any effect. `std::allocator<const T>` is not supported as an extension anymore, please migrate any code that uses e.g. `std::vector<const T>` to be standards conforming.
  - Non-conforming member typedefs `base`, `iterator`, `const_iterator`, `size_type`, `difference_type`, and `const_reference` of `std::bitset`, and member typedef `base` of `std::forward_list` and `std::list` are removed. Previously, these member typedefs (except `const_reference`) were private but could cause ambiguity in name lookup. Code that expects such ambiguity will possibly not compile in LLVM 20.
  - The function `__libcpp_verbose_abort()` is now `noexcept`, to match `std::terminate()`. (The combination of `noexcept` and `[[noreturn]]` has special significance for function effects analysis.) For backwards compatibility, the `_LIBCPP_VERBOSE_ABORT_NOT_NOEXCEPT` macro can be defined to make the function non-`noexcept`. That macro will be removed in LLVM 21.
  - `<ccomplex>`, `<cstdalign>` (previously missing), `<cstdbool>`, and `<ctgmath>` are deprecated since C++17 as specified by the standard. They, together with `<ciso646>`, are removed in C++20, but libc++ still provides these headers as an extension and only deprecates them. The `_LIBCPP_DISABLE_DEPRECATION_WARNINGS` macro can be defined to suppress deprecation for these headers.
  - The pointer safety functions `declare_reachable`, `declare_no_pointers`, `undeclare_no_pointers` and `__undeclare_reachable` have been removed from the library. These functions were never implemented in a non-trivial way, making it very unlikely that any binary depends on them.
  - Non-conforming extension `packaged_task::result_type` is deprecated. It will be removed in LLVM 21.
  - The changes for `ranges::zip_view` from ([P2165R4](https://wg21.link/P2165R4)) have been implemented. This can lead to code assuming that `zip_view` produces `std::pair` to stop compiling now that it produces `std::tuple`. The cases are rare since `tuple` and `pair` are compatible for the most part, but this can lead to code that was previously accepted now being rejected. This is necessary for libc++ to be conforming, so we don’t provide any way to opt-out of that behavior. (151880074)

### [Debugger](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/xcode-release-notes/xcode-26-release-notes#Debugger)

#### [Resolved Issues in Xcode 26 Beta](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/xcode-release-notes/xcode-26-release-notes#Resolved-Issues-in-Xcode-26-Beta)

- Fixed: The debugger is now able to follow a Swift Task when a step operation causes the Task to be migrated to a different thread. (141825713)
- Fixed: The payload of a Swift enum or Optional SBValue is now represented as a synthetic child rather than a direct child. Custom Python data formatters that unwrap Optional values continue to work with this change, as long as do not turn SetPreferSyntheticValue() off. (152662881)

### [Editors](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/xcode-release-notes/xcode-26-release-notes#Editors)

#### [Resolved Issues in Xcode 26 Beta](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/xcode-release-notes/xcode-26-release-notes#Resolved-Issues-in-Xcode-26-Beta)

- Fixed: In Xcode 26 you can control when Editor Tabs are pinned and added. By default Xcode will only create tabs you ask for (File > New > Tab or Option+Click navigation). Automatic pinning is available in Xcode > Settings > Navigation > Pin Tabs Any Editor Tab can be pinned or unpinned by clicking the pin icon or using View > [Pin, Unpin] Editor Tab. (135835457)
- Fixed: The new Start Page in Xcode 26 provides the familiar Open Quickly queries and Related Items in an editor. The Start Page is shown for new Editor Tabs and new Editor Panes without other content. This can be configured in Xcode > Settings > Navigation. (137163041)

### [Foundation](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/xcode-release-notes/xcode-26-release-notes#Foundation)

#### [New Features in Xcode 26 Beta](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/xcode-release-notes/xcode-26-release-notes#New-Features-in-Xcode-26-Beta)

- The `#bundle` macro allows referring to the resource bundle associated with the current Xcode target. You can pass this to any Foundation API expecting a `Bundle`, such as when looking up images or localized strings. (79247613)
- NotificationCenter can post and observe new `Message` types with custom properties and isolation checking (132023811)

### [GameKit](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/xcode-release-notes/xcode-26-release-notes#GameKit)

#### [New Features in Xcode 26 Beta](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/xcode-release-notes/xcode-26-release-notes#New-Features-in-Xcode-26-Beta)

- In addition to Leaderboards and Achievements, you can now also adopt, configure and modify Challenges and Activities directly in Xcode making it easier to enhance engagement in your game. Use Xcode to pull, modify and push Challenges and Activities updates to and from App Store Connect. The Game Progress Manager in Xcode allows you to test your Party Codes locally during development by modifying properties, reporting updates and resetting resources. These real-time updates can be used to verify that the Activity changed as expected. (144816182)

### [Instruments](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/xcode-release-notes/xcode-26-release-notes#Instruments)

#### [New Features in Xcode 26 Beta](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/xcode-release-notes/xcode-26-release-notes#New-Features-in-Xcode-26-Beta)

- Target chooser has been redesigned from the ground up to improve the device and process selection experience. Changes include:

  - Move of the control from the toolbar to the Next Recording section, unifying all the settings relevant for the next run in one place.
  - Ability to filter available set of processes to launch or attach, including apps, launch agents and daemons.
  - Quick access to modify the environment or arguments for a process being launched by Instruments. (79987176)
- CPU Counters has been reworked to support a performance optimization methodology called Bottleneck Analysis, which uses preset modes that provide a “guided” path to using counters. The CPU Bottlenecks template configures the counters to initially break down down sustainable CPU bandwidth into four broad categories:

  - Useful: CPU resources were used to make forward progress in your code
  - Instruction Delivery: the CPU could not provide enough instructions for processing
  - Instruction Processing: instructions are not executing quickly due to their relative cost or data not being ready
  - Discarded: incorrect speculative execution wasted bandwidth.

    Each category aside from Useful has one or more further recommended modes to narrow in on instruction sequences that are preventing the CPU from executing efficiently. There are also traditional modes that measure the characteristics of executed instructions or metrics about their execution, like the number of L1 Data Cache misses.

    Manual mode for configuring Counters is still available and can be accessed from the instrument recording options. (86470694)
- Power Profiler is a new instrument designed to visualize system power usage and the power impact of an application on different subsystems like CPU, GPU or networking. To use the tool, drag it from the instruments library and record a trace on an iOS or iPadOS device. Process metrics are only present when using “Launch” or “Attach” recording modes in Instruments. Instruments also supports analysis of traces taken on-device using the Power Profiler feature in the Developer settings. To visualize captured trace, open the resulting .atrc file in Instruments, which will present both power data and CPU samples captured alongside. (135759149)
- The SwiftUI template has been updated with a next-generation SwiftUI instrument. The new instrument captures the duration of all of the updates SwiftUI performs, making it easy to identify long updates that may be negatively impacting app performance. It also tracks the causes of each update, allowing you to understand why view bodies are running, using the new Cause & Effect Graph. (137637030)
- Timeline content tooltips are now rendered in multiline lines when applicable. (139212962)
- Instruments General settings features a new “Attach Supporting files” toggle, allows Instruments to attach imported files or underlying Apple Trace files as part of the .trace container when enabled. (144313007)
- Added ability to name runs with `xctrace record` using `run-name` argument. Run names are presented when trace is subsequently opened in Instruments. (144883457)
- Animation Hitches Instrument has been redesigned to address correctness and performance issues. New version supports multiple displays across the platforms, includes application update intervals and more reliably reports hitching frames. Volume of recorded data has been reduced significantly, contributing to faster trace processing times. (146033792)
- Instruments Settings view has been redesigned for readability. (146418991)
- The Foundation Models instrument is a new tool designed to help developers profile their app’s usage of the FoundationModels framework. The instrument provides insights into the app’s requests and different phases, such as asset loading, prompt processing, and inference details. To use it, drag it from the Instruments library and record a new trace. (148055761)
- Call Tree has an ability to view all the aggregated samples using the “Focus” submenu for a node. The “Focus” button available on hover now defaults to showing the submenu with multiple actions instead of invoking “Focus on Subtree”. (148098893)
- Secondary clicking on a track in the timeline now offers a context menu with actions that allow for track pinning, copying represented value or adding it to various filters across the application. (148666063)
- Tracks in the timeline are now automatically sized to fit the plots inside. Tracks can still be resized manually using cursor or CMD+, CMD- keyboard shortcuts (148943810)
- Swift Concurrency template now surfaces names of tasks given using the new API available in Swift 6.2. (149797014)

#### [Resolved Issues in Xcode 26 Beta](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/xcode-release-notes/xcode-26-release-notes#Resolved-Issues-in-Xcode-26-Beta)

- Fixed: Copy of unsymbolicated frames from a call tree view now includes names of libraries. (141645741)
- Fixed: Copy and Copy with Header actions are now properly handled in the aggregation detail views across Instruments. (146333462)
- Fixed: Resolves a large memory leak happening when recording with the User Space Sampler Instrument. (146506463)
- Fixed issues with the metric calculation in the CPU Counters Instrument happening during thread context switches (147776170)
- Fixed: Set Inspection Range and Zoom action is now available as a standalone menu item instead of an alternate. (149986438)
- Fixed an issue where pinned timeline wouldn’t be sized appropriately when presented. (150055669)
- Fixed: Main menu of Instruments has been simplified. Document menu has been removed and its actions have been moved under `View`. (150067894)
- Fixed: Pause / Resume button has been removed from the toolbar. It is still present in the main menu of the application. (150984980)
- Fixed an issue where resizing the timeline track by dragging would sometimes get stuck or not be responsive to user’s action. (151040978)
- Fixed: Plot titles in the timeline will now show tooltips when the text is truncated. (151046422)

#### [Deprecations in Xcode 26 Beta](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/xcode-release-notes/xcode-26-release-notes#Deprecations-in-Xcode-26-Beta)

- Support for profiling WatchKit 1.0 applications has been removed. (139213888)
- The Zombies template has been removed. To record Zombies, select the “Allocations” template and enable the “Enable NSZombie detection” checkbox. (146791790)
- The SceneKit template has been removed. SceneKit Instrument remains available in the library. (146791805)
- Previous SwiftUI template containing View Body and View Properties Instruments have been replaced. The instruments are now deprecated and still available in the instruments library. (148596828)

### [Localization](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/xcode-release-notes/xcode-26-release-notes#Localization)

#### [New Features in Xcode 26 Beta](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/xcode-release-notes/xcode-26-release-notes#New-Features-in-Xcode-26-Beta)

- Xcode can now generate type-safe Swift symbols for manually-managed strings in String Catalogs. For example, a string in Localizable.xcstrings with key “Landmarks” and value “%(count)lld landmarks” can be accessed via `LocalizedStringResource.landmarks(count: 42)`. You can enable this via the build setting “Generate String Catalog Symbols”. (110427968) (FB12264530)
- The String Catalog Editor now supports selecting and performing actions on multiple strings at once. (110457331) (FB12271972)
- Xcode can now use source code context to generate translation comments in a String Catalog. Use “Generate Comment” in the context menu to generate comments for existing strings. To ensure newly-extracted strings get comments by default, turn on “Automatically generate string catalog comments” in Settings > Editing. This requires Xcode’s on-device predictive code completion model. (111708155)
- The Refactor menu in String Catalogs and the Source Editor now lets you change a string key across all code files and String Catalogs. (129261942)
- A new Refactor menu in the String Catalog Editor allows converting one or more strings between automatically-extracted string literals and manually-managed strings referenced via Swift symbols. This allows you to update source code at the same time as making String Catalog changes. These operations are also accessible via the Refactor menu in the Source Editor. (129261981)
- Expressive Format Specifiers in String Catalogs allow you to add a name to any format specifier. For example, `%(landmarkCount)lld` clearly communicates that the integer passed in at runtime represents a count of landmarks. These format specifiers will be included in the exported Localization Catalog (.xcloc) to help guide translators. (136543666)
- When typing “%” in a String Catalog, an auto-completion menu suggests relevant format specifiers for your string. (139033592)

### [Security](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/xcode-release-notes/xcode-26-release-notes#Security)

#### [New Features in Xcode 26 Beta](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/xcode-release-notes/xcode-26-release-notes#New-Features-in-Xcode-26-Beta)

- Xcode now provides an “Enhanced Security” extension template, which you can use to separate sensitive calculations, such as handling data from untrusted sources, into an extension that the system runs as a separate process from your app. For more information see https://developer.apple.com/documentation/xcode/creating-extensions-with-enhanced-security (141308470)
- Xcode now provides an “Enhanced Security” capability, which enables additional runtime and compile-time protections for your application and builds it with pointer authentication enabled. For more information see https://developer.apple.com/documentation/xcode/enabling-enhanced-security-for-your-app (143278278)
- Clang now supports a language extension for C, `-fbounds-safety`, that guarantees bounds safety. The extension also provides bounds annotations that you can use to specify bounds information for pointers and arrays. The compiler informs you where to add bounds annotations through errors and warnings and automatically inserts guaranteed bounds checks at run time. To enable this extension, set the `ENABLE_CLANG_BOUNDS_SAFETY` build setting to `YES`. For more information see -fbounds-safety: Enforcing bounds safety for C﻿. (149099879)
- Clang now supports a strict programming model that guarantees bounds safety in C++ by rejecting raw pointer arithmetic and requiring the use of hardened C++ Standard Library APIs for buffer manipulation. To enable this mode set the `ENABLE_CPLUSPLUS_BOUNDS_SAFE_BUFFERS` build setting to `YES`. (150517840)

### [Swift Interoperability with C/C++](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/xcode-release-notes/xcode-26-release-notes#Swift-Interoperability-with-CC++)

#### [New Features in Xcode 26 Beta](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/xcode-release-notes/xcode-26-release-notes#New-Features-in-Xcode-26-Beta)

- Swift compiler now automatically infers `SWIFT_SHARED_REFERENCE` annotation for C++ types inheriting from a base that is annotated with `SWIFT_SHARED_REFERENCE`. The derived type is imported as a Swift class or reference-counted type with the same `retain` and `release` operations as the base type. (97914474)
- You can now annotate C and C++ functions with bounds and lifetime annotations that enable Swift to import them without the need for unsafe boilerplate. This feature is currently experimental. To enable it, add the `-enable-experimental-feature SafeInteropWrappers` to your `OTHER_SWIFT_FLAGS` build setting.

  Add `__noescape` to a C or C++ function parameter to indicate that the parameter doesn’t escape the function. If you annotate a parameter of `std::span` type with `__noescape`, the compiler generates a safe overload that directly takes a Span in Swift.

  Add `__lifetimebound` on a C or C++ function parameter to indicate that the return value of the function does not outlive the objects referred to by that parameter. If you annotate a parameter with `__lifetimebound` and the return value is of `std::span` type, the compiler will generate a safe overload that directly returns a Span.

  You can annotate raw C and C++ pointers with these lifetime annotation and also with bounds annotations, such as `__counted_by(N)`, which indicate that the raw pointer points to memory containing at least `N` elements. If you add both a lifetime annotation and a bounds annotation to a raw pointer in a function parameter, Swift will import it as a Span. Here is an example:

  ```
    // C/C++
    #include <lifetimebound.h>
    #include <ptrcheck.h>
    void initializeBuffer(int * __counted_by(len) p __noescape, size_t len);
           
    // Unsafe overload in Swift
    func initializeBuffer(_ p: UnsafeMutablePointer<CInt>, _ len: Int)
           
    // Safe overload in Swift
    func initializeBuffer(_ p: inout MutableSpan<CInt>)

  ```

  Note that the safe overload of initializeBuffer doesn’t contain a separate len parameter because MutableSpan already contains its count.

  Similarly, if you annotate a parameter with `__lifetimebound` and annotate a function return type with a bounds annotation, Swift will import the return type as a Span.

  For `void *` or pointers to type with an unknown size, you can use the `__sized_by(N)` bounds annotation which indicates that the pointer points to memory of at least `N` bytes. (97942270)
- Constructors of C++ `SWIFT_SHARED_REFERENCE` types are now callable from Swift as initializers, allowing these types to be constructed directly from Swift. (131557219)
- Objective-C and Objective-C++ APIs that return C++ `SWIFT_SHARED_REFERENCE` types can now be annotated with `SWIFT_RETURNS_RETAINED` or `SWIFT_RETURNS_UNRETAINED` annotations. (135360972)
- C++ classes can be annotated with `SWIFT_PRIVATE_FILEID` to allow Swift extensions of those classes to access their `private` and `protected` members. This annotation is defined in the `swift/bridging` header and takes a fileID as its argument (e.g., `SWIFT_PRIVATE_FILEID("MyModule/MyFile.swift")`). For C++ classes with this annotation, non-`public` members are treated as if they were defined as `private` in the Swift source file designated by the fileID. (137764620)
- Objective-C and Objective-C++ functions and methods that return C++ `SWIFT_SHARED_REFERENCE` types can now use the new `SwiftReturnOwnership:` API Notes attribute to specify ownership. Set the value to `retained` or `unretained` to apply the corresponding `SWIFT_RETURNS_RETAINED` or `SWIFT_RETURNS_UNRETAINED` annotation. (142504115)
- You can now annotate function parameters and return values of clang modules with bounds attributes using APINotes. This lets you to create safe Swift interfaces when using the SafeInteropWrappers feature without modifying the headers of external modules. Example:

  ```
   // C header
   void foo(int * p, size_t len);
   void * bar(size_t size, size_t count);
   
   // APINotes
   Name: MyBoundsModule
   Functions:
     - Name: foo
       Parameters:
         - Position: 0
           BoundsSafety:
             Kind: counted_by
             BoundedBy: "len"
     - Name: bar
       BoundsSafety:
         Kind: sized_by
         BoundedBy: "size * count"

  ```

- Static C++ factory functions returning `SWIFT_SHARED_REFERENCE` types are now imported as Swift initializers, as long as they are annotated with `SWIFT_NAME("init(_:_:_:)")`, with the underscore placeholders matching the factory function’s parameter count. (152457366)
