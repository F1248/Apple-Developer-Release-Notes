### [General](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/xcode-release-notes/xcode-16_4-release-notes#General)

#### [Known Issues](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/xcode-release-notes/xcode-16_4-release-notes#Known-Issues)

- Users may see excessive CPU utilization from diskimagesiod which reduces simulator performance, increasing boot time, process launch times, and test execution times. (146716769) (FB16818022)

### [Apple Clang Compiler](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/xcode-release-notes/xcode-16_4-release-notes#Apple-Clang-Compiler)

#### [Resolved Issues](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/xcode-release-notes/xcode-16_4-release-notes#Resolved-Issues)

- Fixed: The base template for `std::char_traits` is restored after being removed in Xcode 16.3; it is still deprecated and is going to be removed in a future release. Restoring the base template allows code that attempts to instantiate `char_traits` with types that are not provided by the Standard (for example, `std::basic_string<long long>` and similar) to still compile, giving it more time to transition.  (149025504)
