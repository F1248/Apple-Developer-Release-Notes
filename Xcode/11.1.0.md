# Xcode 11.1 Release Notes

Update your apps to use new features, and test your apps against API changes.

## [Overview](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/xcode-release-notes/xcode-11_1-release-notes#Overview)

Xcode 11.1 includes SDKs for iOS 13.1, macOS Catalina 10.15, watchOS 6, and tvOS 13. Xcode 11.1 supports on-device debugging for iOS 8 and later, tvOS 9 and later, and watchOS 2 and later. Xcode 11.1 requires a Mac running macOS Mojave 10.14.4 or later.

### [General](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/xcode-release-notes/xcode-11_1-release-notes#General)

#### [Known Issues](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/xcode-release-notes/xcode-11_1-release-notes#Known-Issues)

- Xcode may fail to update from the Mac App Store after updating to macOS Catalina. (56061273)

  **Workaround**: To trigger a new download you can delete the existing Xcode.app or temporarily change the file extension so it is no longer visible to the App Store.

### [Asset Catalogs](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/xcode-release-notes/xcode-11_1-release-notes#Asset-Catalogs)

#### [Known Issues](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/xcode-release-notes/xcode-11_1-release-notes#Known-Issues)

- Images in the asset catalog won’t be found at runtime when running on watchOS 4. (55395258)

### [Interface Builder](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/xcode-release-notes/xcode-11_1-release-notes#Interface-Builder)

#### [New Features](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/xcode-release-notes/xcode-11_1-release-notes#New-Features)

- You can now preview your interface for the 7th generation iPad. (53957165)

#### [Known Issues](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/xcode-release-notes/xcode-11_1-release-notes#Known-Issues)

- There is an issue with [`UITabBarController`](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/UIKit/UITabBarController) where decoding an instance from a storyboard will create some extra views at the left end of the screen. Developers may remove these by applying a workaround. (55310448)

  **Workaround**: To remove the extraneous views from Storyboard, create a subclass of a [`UITabBarController`](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/UIKit/UITabBarController) and add the following snippet in the class’s [`init(coder:)`](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/UIKit/UIViewController/init(coder:)) method:

  ```
  class WorkaroundTabBarController: UITabBarController {
      required init?(coder: NSCoder) {
          super.init(coder: coder)


          // This must be run immediately after the call to super.
          if tabBar.subviews.count > 1 {
              tabBar.subviews[0].isHidden = true
          }
      }
  }
  ```

#### [Resolved Issues](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/xcode-release-notes/xcode-11_1-release-notes#Resolved-Issues)

- Fixed a crash that sometimes occurred when compiling XIB files in iOS projects that backwards deploy to iOS versions earlier than 13.0. (55271752)

### [Localization](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/xcode-release-notes/xcode-11_1-release-notes#Localization)

#### [Known Issues](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/xcode-release-notes/xcode-11_1-release-notes#Known-Issues)

- [`UITableViewCell`](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/UIKit/UITableViewCell) labels in storyboards and XIB files do not use localized string values from the strings file at runtime. (52839404)

### [Simulator](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/xcode-release-notes/xcode-11_1-release-notes#Simulator)

#### [Known Issues](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/xcode-release-notes/xcode-11_1-release-notes#Known-Issues)

- On macOS Catalina, iCloud Drive will crash in a loop on simulated devices running older versions of iOS. (51392951, 54282967, 54818084)

  **Workaround**: Log out of iCloud in impacted simulators to halt the crash cycle.

#### [Resolved Issues](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/xcode-release-notes/xcode-11_1-release-notes#Resolved-Issues)

- CarPlay works on iOS 13.1 simulators. (54492162)

### [Swift](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/xcode-release-notes/xcode-11_1-release-notes#Swift)

#### [Known Issues](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/xcode-release-notes/xcode-11_1-release-notes#Known-Issues)

- The `NEHotspotConfigurationError` enum from the [Network Extension](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/NetworkExtension) framework changed from `NS_ENUM` to `NS_ERROR_ENUM`, which can cause compiler errors in existing Swift code that uses the enum. For example, in code like this:

  ```
  let code = NEHotspotConfigurationError(rawValue: errorCode)
  ```

  You will see the error message: “error: incorrect argument label in call (have ‘rawValue:’, expected ‘\_nsError:’).” (54134493)

  **Workaround**: Replace references of `NEHotspotConfigurationError` with [`NEHotspotConfigurationError`](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/NetworkExtension/NEHotspotConfigurationError). For the above example, change the code to:

  ```
  let code = NEHotspotConfigurationError.Code(rawValue: errorCode)
  ```

### [SwiftUI](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/xcode-release-notes/xcode-11_1-release-notes#SwiftUI)

#### [Resolved Issues](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/xcode-release-notes/xcode-11_1-release-notes#Resolved-Issues)

- Fixed an issue with Xcode Previews where debugging a preview would no longer pin the preview, and navigating would lose the debug session. (54758098)

### [Swift Packages](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/xcode-release-notes/xcode-11_1-release-notes#Swift-Packages)

#### [Known Issues](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/xcode-release-notes/xcode-11_1-release-notes#Known-Issues)

- If an iOS, tvOS, or watchOS app uses a Swift Package that builds a dynamic library, it cannot be submitted to the App Store. (55564324)

  **Workaround**: Modify the Package manifest to build a static library.

### [watchOS](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/xcode-release-notes/xcode-11_1-release-notes#watchOS)

#### [Known Issues](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/xcode-release-notes/xcode-11_1-release-notes#Known-Issues)

- watchOS applications built with the watchOS 6 SDK and a deployment target of watchOS 5.3 will crash on launch when run on watchOS 5.3. (55360395)

  **Workaround**: Set the `__WKEXTENSIONMAIN_LEGACY_TARGET_5_3` build setting to “legacy,” or use another deployment target instead of 5.3.
