# Xcode 11.3 Release Notes

Update your apps to use new features, and test your apps against API changes

## [Overview](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/xcode-release-notes/xcode-11_3-release-notes#Overview)

Xcode 11.3 supports developing apps for iOS 13.3, iPadOS 13.3, tvOS 13.3, watchOS 6.1, and macOS Catalina 10.15.2. Xcode 11.3 supports on-device debugging for iOS 8 and later, tvOS 9 and later, and watchOS 2 and later. Xcode 11.3 requires a Mac running macOS Mojave 10.14.4 or later.

### [General](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/xcode-release-notes/xcode-11_3-release-notes#General)

#### [New Features](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/xcode-release-notes/xcode-11_3-release-notes#New-Features)

- You can configure the Touch Bar simulator to simulate either 1st generation or 2nd generation Touch Bars. (53885368)

#### [Known Issues](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/xcode-release-notes/xcode-11_3-release-notes#Known-Issues)

- When you create an Objective-C category file by choosing File > New > File…, the newly created file includes an import of the AppKit framework. This causes a compilation error for iOS, tvOS, and watchOS. (55977950) (FB7346800)

  **Workaround**: Remove the import of AppKit from the source file.

### [Create ML](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/xcode-release-notes/xcode-11_3-release-notes#Create-ML)

#### [New Features](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/xcode-release-notes/xcode-11_3-release-notes#New-Features)

- A Recommender template is available in Create ML, joining the Image, Sound, Activity, Text and Tabular Classification, Object Detection, Word Tagging and Tabular Regression templates. (56912822)

### [Interface Builder](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/xcode-release-notes/xcode-11_3-release-notes#Interface-Builder)

#### [Known Issues](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/xcode-release-notes/xcode-11_3-release-notes#Known-Issues)

- The color picker panel does not respond to choosing a color while a text field in the inspector has insertion focus. (56067005) (FB7358220)

  **Workaround**: Click the Interface Builder canvas to remove focus from the text field, then choose a color in the panel.

#### [Resolved Issues](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/xcode-release-notes/xcode-11_3-release-notes#Resolved-Issues)

- Setting the Selected Segment Tint Color of a segmented control in Interface Builder to a named color doesn’t cause a failure when the view loads on iOS 12 and earlier. (55254963, 55951374)
- Fixed rendering issues for scenes with large simulated metric free-form sizes. (56920189)

### [Previews](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/xcode-release-notes/xcode-11_3-release-notes#Previews)

#### [New Features](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/xcode-release-notes/xcode-11_3-release-notes#New-Features)

- Xcode Previews now use a platform-provided scroll view for the canvas content when running on macOS Catalina 10.15.2 or newer. This change makes it possible to scroll through the canvas using a scroll wheel on a mouse, as well as by dragging horizontal and vertical scrollbars. (53962570)

### [Simulator](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/xcode-release-notes/xcode-11_3-release-notes#Simulator)

#### [Known Issues](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/xcode-release-notes/xcode-11_3-release-notes#Known-Issues)

- Third party “endpoint security” software may cause slow simulators, system freezes, or prevent debug processes from running in simulators reliably. This sometimes manifests as `debugserver` disconnections, or sends simulator applications a `SIGKILL` signal. (55853555)

  **Workaround**: Uninstall the third party software.
- Under certain network conditions, GateKeeper may block simulators from booting, and show error code 60 `"launchd` failed to respond.” (55878667)

  **Workaround**: Try to boot the simulator again. Disabling WiFi or disconnecting from any active VPNs may resolve the problem.
- When a new Mac Pro has multiple GPUs, Simulator assigns each booted simulator to one of the available GPUs. (56488185)

### [Swift Packages](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/xcode-release-notes/xcode-11_3-release-notes#Swift-Packages)

#### [Resolved Issues](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/xcode-release-notes/xcode-11_3-release-notes#Resolved-Issues)

- You can now submit iOS, tvOS, or watchOS apps with a Swift Package that builds a dynamic library. (55564324) (FB7303066)
