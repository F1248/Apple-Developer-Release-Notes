# watchOS 8.5 Release Notes

Update your apps to use new features, and test your apps against API changes.

## [Overview](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/watchos-release-notes/watchos-8_5-release-notes#overview)

The watchOS 8.5 SDK provides support to develop watchOS apps for Apple Watch devices running watchOS 8.5. The SDK comes bundled with Xcode 13.3.1, available from the Mac App Store. For information on the compatibility requirements for Xcode 13.3.1, see [Xcode 13.3.1 Release Notes](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/Xcode-Release-Notes/xcode-13_3_1-release-notes).

### [Apple Pay](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/watchos-release-notes/watchos-8_5-release-notes#Apple-Pay)

#### [New Features](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/watchos-release-notes/watchos-8_5-release-notes#New-Features)

- Developers are able to express the preference for payment networks in [`PKPaymentRequest`](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/PassKit/PKPaymentRequest). Network preference is determined by the order of [`supportedNetworks`](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/PassKit/PKPaymentRequest/supportedNetworks). This won’t override the user’s default card selection, but if the card is multi-SSD, then the network preference order determines which SSD is selected. (80827905)

### [libc++](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/watchos-release-notes/watchos-8_5-release-notes#libc++)

#### [New Features](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/watchos-release-notes/watchos-8_5-release-notes#New-Features)

- The following new C++20 and C++23 features are now implemented:

  - C++20 library concepts defined in `<concepts>`.
  - `constexpr` for `std::swap()` and swap-related functions.
  - Miscellaneous `constexpr`-ification in the library.
  - `std::atomic` now default initializes as expected.
  - A `.contains()` method for associative containers.
  - Added `std::bind_front()`. (88131816)

#### [Deprecations](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/watchos-release-notes/watchos-8_5-release-notes#Deprecations)

- Some extensions in `std::tuple` were removed to fix bugs caused by those extensions:

  - Tuples can no longer be constructed from fewer than the number of elements in the tuple. Previously, elements that weren’t specified were default-constructed; now this is a compiler error.
  - A tuple can no longer be constructed from an array.
  - The `std::result_of` and `std::is_literal_type` type traits are no longer available in C++20 mode, as specified in the Standard.

### [Siri](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/watchos-release-notes/watchos-8_5-release-notes#Siri)

#### [Known Issues](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/watchos-release-notes/watchos-8_5-release-notes#Known-Issues)

- Siri may not properly recognize the user’s speech on Apple Watch Series 3. (86107552)

### [StoreKit](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/watchos-release-notes/watchos-8_5-release-notes#StoreKit)

#### [New Features](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/watchos-release-notes/watchos-8_5-release-notes#New-Features)

- [`SKTestSession`](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/StoreKitTest/SKTestSession) has three new methods to simulate a subscription requiring price increase consent, simulate consenting to a pending price increase, and simulate declining a price increase in automated tests. (84556183)

- `SKTestSession` has two new Boolean properties to simulate billing retry and grace period in automated tests. You can identify and simulate the resolution of billing retry issues using the same APIs as interrupted purchases. (83956205)

- Users can now test the billing retry and grace period states using StoreKit Testing in Xcode. Use Xcode 13.3 or later to enable billing retry testing and toggle whether the app offers a grace period. Use [`isInBillingRetry`](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/StoreKit/Product/SubscriptionInfo/RenewalInfo/isInBillingRetry) and [`gracePeriodExpirationDate`](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/StoreKit/Product/SubscriptionInfo/RenewalInfo/gracePeriodExpirationDate) to handle these states in the app. (83938270)

- Users can test subscription price increase behavior using StoreKit Testing in Xcode. Use Xcode 13.3 or later to set a price increase, then use [`paymentQueueShouldShowPriceConsent(_:)`](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/StoreKit/SKPaymentQueueDelegate/paymentQueueShouldShowPriceConsent(_:)), [`showPriceConsentIfNeeded()`](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/StoreKit/SKPaymentQueue/showPriceConsentIfNeeded()), and [`priceIncreaseStatus`](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/StoreKit/Product/SubscriptionInfo/RenewalInfo/priceIncreaseStatus-swift.property) in the app. (58770817)

- `StoreKit` error types now conform to [`LocalizedError`](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/foundation/localizederror). (78735204)

- Some types in `StoreKit` now have a `localizedDescription` read-only `String` instance property. This property can be used to get a human-readable description of the value, localized for the device’s current locale. These types include: [`Product.ProductType`](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/StoreKit/Product/ProductType), [`Product.SubscriptionInfo.RenewalState`](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/StoreKit/Product/SubscriptionInfo/RenewalState), [`expirationReason`](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/StoreKit/Product/SubscriptionInfo/RenewalInfo/expirationReason-swift.property), [`priceIncreaseStatus`](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/StoreKit/Product/SubscriptionInfo/RenewalInfo/priceIncreaseStatus-swift.property), [`Transaction.OfferType`](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/StoreKit/Transaction/OfferType-swift.struct), [`Product.SubscriptionOffer.OfferType`](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/StoreKit/Product/SubscriptionOffer/OfferType), [`Product.SubscriptionOffer.PaymentMode`](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/StoreKit/Product/SubscriptionOffer/PaymentMode-swift.struct), [`Product.SubscriptionPeriod.Unit`](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/StoreKit/Product/SubscriptionPeriod/Unit-swift.enum), [`Transaction.RevocationReason`](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/StoreKit/Transaction/RevocationReason-swift.struct), and [`Transaction.OwnershipType`](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/StoreKit/Transaction/OwnershipType-swift.struct).
