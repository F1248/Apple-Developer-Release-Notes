# watchOS 9 Release Notes

Update your apps to use new features, and test your apps against API changes.

## [Overview](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/watchos-release-notes/watchos-9-release-notes#overview)

The watchOS 9 SDK provides support to develop watchOS apps for Apple Watch devices running watchOS 9. The SDK comes bundled with Xcode 14, available from the Mac App Store. For information on the compatibility requirements for Xcode 14, see [Xcode 14 Release Notes](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/Xcode-Release-Notes/xcode-14-release-notes).

### [General](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/watchos-release-notes/watchos-9-release-notes#General)

- After updating to watchOS 9, your Apple Watch Series 4 or Series 5 will recalibrate and then estimate its maximum battery capacity more accurately. (93206868)

### [CallKit](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/watchos-release-notes/watchos-9-release-notes#CallKit)

#### [Known Issues](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/watchos-release-notes/watchos-9-release-notes#Known-Issues)

- Compilation of apps integrated with CallKit might result in an error: “Value of type `CXProviderConfiguration` has no member `supportedHandleTypes` on watchOS 9”. (97582165)

- The `recentSubscriptionStartDate` property is included in [`Product.SubscriptionInfo.RenewalInfo`](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/StoreKit/Product/SubscriptionInfo/RenewalInfo).

- `Product` has new properties for localizing prices and subscription periods. For iOS 15, iPadOS 15, macOS 12, tvOS 15, and watchOS 8 or later use `priceFormatStyle` to format numbers derived from `price`. Use `subscriptionPeriodFormatStyle` to format durations of time relating to a subscription period. On iOS 16, iPadOS 16, macOS 13, tvOS 16, and watchOS 9 or later use `subscriptionPeriodUnitFormatStyle` to format single units of a subscription period. (93780442)

- A property environment is included in [`Product.SubscriptionInfo.RenewalInfo`](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/StoreKit/Product/SubscriptionInfo/RenewalInfo) and [`Transaction`](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/StoreKit/Transaction).

### [SwiftUI](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/watchos-release-notes/watchos-9-release-notes#SwiftUI)

If the `label` views are intended to be arranged horizontally rather than hierarchically, wrap the views within an [`HStack`](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/SwiftUI/HStack). (85184563)
